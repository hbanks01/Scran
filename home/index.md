Student Scran is a website dedicated to broadening the culinary horizons of students around the world.

In curating and publishing a wide range of recipes, we have showcased many recipes in our time operating. Our main aim is to ensure that those short on time and/ or cooking experience do not miss out on home-cooked meals oozing flavour and complexity.

Being a student myself, I understand the balancing act endured by many. Finding time to cook delicious meals is hard whilst studying, leading me to compile our latest text, Pork Bites. The collection was, in fact, generated by AI resources (ChatGPT) and, subsequently, tried and tested - with our small team tweaking recipes here and there using cooking techniques researched to ensure authenticity as well as simplicity.
