**Ingredients**:

* 2 lbs pork belly, skin-on, cut into 1 1/2-inch cubes
* 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
* 1 onion, chopped
* 3 garlic cloves, minced
* 2-inch piece of ginger, sliced
* 2 star anise
* 1 cinnamon stick
* 3 tablespoons fish sauce
* 2 tablespoons soy sauce
* 2 tablespoons palm sugar (or brown sugar)
* 2 cups water
* 2 green onions, thinly sliced

**Method**:

1. Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the pork belly cubes and brown them on all sides for about 5-7 minutes. Remove the pork belly from the pot and set aside.
2. Add the chopped onion to the same pot and cook for 2-3 minutes until translucent. Add the minced garlic, sliced ginger, star anise, and cinnamon stick to the pot and cook for another minute until fragrant.
3. Add the fish sauce, soy sauce, and palm sugar to the pot and stir until the sugar has dissolved. Add the pork belly back to the pot and stir to coat it with the sauce.
4. Pour in 2 cups of water, bring to a boil, and then reduce the heat to low. Cover the pot and let it simmer for 2-2.5 hours, or until the pork is tender and the sauce has thickened.
5. Once the pork is cooked, remove the cinnamon stick and star anise from the pot. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the pork belly cubes to a serving dish.
6. To make the garnish, mix the thinly sliced green onions with a pinch of salt in a small bowl.
7. Serve the braised pork belly hot, garnished with the green onion mixture. This dish is typically served with steamed rice and some fresh vegetables on the side.
