**Ingredients**:

* 2 pounds pork shoulder
* 1 cup barbecue sauce
* 1/2 cup chicken broth
* 1 tablespoon chili powder
* 1 tablespoon paprika
* 1 tablespoon garlic powder
* 1 tablespoon onion powder
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
* 12 small flour tortillas
* 1 cup shredded lettuce
* 1/2 cup chopped tomatoes
* 1/4 cup chopped red onion
* 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
* Lime wedges for serving

**Method**:

1. Preheat your oven to 325°F (160°C).
2. In a small bowl, mix together the chili powder, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and black pepper to create a dry rub.
3. Rub the dry rub all over the pork shoulder, making sure to coat it evenly.
4. Place the pork shoulder in a large baking dish and pour the chicken broth over it.
5. Cover the baking dish tightly with foil and place it in the preheated oven.
6. Bake the pork shoulder for 3-4 hours or until it is tender and falls apart easily with a fork.
7. Remove the pork shoulder from the oven and let it cool slightly.
8. Using two forks, shred the pork shoulder into bite-sized pieces.
9. In a large skillet over medium heat, combine the shredded pork and barbecue sauce.
10. Cook the pork and barbecue sauce together for 5-10 minutes or until the pork is heated through and coated in the sauce.
11. Warm the flour tortillas in the oven or on the stovetop.
12. To assemble the tacos, place a spoonful of the pulled pork onto each tortilla.
13. Top the pork with shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes, chopped red onion, and chopped cilantro.
14. Squeeze a lime wedge over each taco.
15. Serve and enjoy!
